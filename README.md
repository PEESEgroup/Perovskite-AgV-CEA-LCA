# Perovskite Agrivoltaic Greenhouse Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)
This repository contains the complete dataset, simulation files, and statistical analyses supporting our study on semi-transparent perovskite (STP) agrivoltaic (AgV) greenhouses. Our work evaluates the energy savings, carbon footprint, and water use impacts of integrating STP photovoltaic glazing into greenhouse systems across diverse U.S. climates.

ðŸ”¬ Research Context
This analysis is part of the first holistic "farm-to-fork" LCA evaluating the integration of STP PV into CEA systems. By simulating 925 U.S. deployment sites, we quantify environmental trade-offs and highlight the regional benefits of perovskite AgV technologies.
