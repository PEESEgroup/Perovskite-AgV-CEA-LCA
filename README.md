## üßæ Abstract

Climate change, resource scarcity, and growing demand for high-quality produce pose major challenges to global food security and sustainability. Controlled environment agriculture offers resilience but is constrained by its high energy intensity, a challenge that can be addressed by integrating advanced photovoltaic (PV) technologies such as semi-transparent perovskites (STP). Here, we present the first holistic, ‚Äúfarm-to-fork‚Äù life cycle assessment investigating the synergy of STP PV and greenhouse horticulture. Using high-fidelity simulations across diverse U.S. climates, we show that STP agrivoltaic (AgV) greenhouses offer a transformative solution for sustainable food production, achieving up to 360.5 MWh/year energy savings in hot-humid climates and enabling widespread emission reductions of up to 38.9%. In arid regions, achieving substantial water savings of 0.447 m3/kg is contingent upon continued advancements in the power conversion efficiency. Despite concerns about stability, the substantial baseline consumption and resource savings outweigh additional impacts due to multi-round recycling of end-of-life solar devices. STP AgVs offer a scalable, near-term solution for perovskite solar deployment, with potential applicability across thousands of hectares of U.S. greenhouse area in global agri-food systems.
